  line Conclusions
    + q1 = It is certain that Global Mean Surface Temperature has increased since the late 19th century. Each of the past three decades has been successively warmer at the Earthâ€™s surface than all the previous decades in the instrumental record, and the  rst decade of the 21st century has been the warmest.
      \ 24
    + q2 = It is unlikely that any uncorrected urban heat-island effects and land use change effects have raised the estimated centennial globally averaged LSAT trends by more than 10% of the reported trend.
      \ 241
    + q3 = Confidence is medium in reported decreases in observed global diurnal temperature range (DTR), noted as a key uncertainty in the AR4.
      \ 241
    + q4 = Based on multiple independent analyses of measurements from radiosondes and satellite sensors it is virtually certain that globally the troposphere has warmed and the stratosphere has cooled since the mid-20th century.
